## Description
A folder that's in sync with a playlist on youtube.

## Usage
You select a folder on the computer and a playlist from youtube.
The program will compare the local files with the playlist files.
The files not present in the folder will be downloaded.

## Problems
Youtube seems to be protecting certain youtube-file-links,
resulting in them not being available for download.
